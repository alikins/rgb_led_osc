Code to drive an rgb led attached to an arduino. 

Processing is used to accept OSC messages, and forward them
over a the serial port/usb to an arduino, which controls
the rgb led.

The touchOSC file is a control layout for the touchOSC iphone
app. 

In other words, make a small light change colors via a gui
on your iphone.
